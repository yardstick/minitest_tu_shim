= minitest_tu_shim

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts

== DESCRIPTION:

minitest_tu_shim bridges the gap between the small and fast minitest
and ruby's huge and slow test/unit.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Fully test/unit compatible assertions.
* Allows test/unit to be required, firing up an autorunner.
* Incompatible at the runner level. Does not replicate test/unit's internals.

== REQUIREMENTS:

+ minitest
+ Ruby 1.8, maybe even 1.6 or lower. No magic is involved.

== INSTALL:

+ Add `gem 'minitest-display'` to your Gemfile.

== LICENSE:
